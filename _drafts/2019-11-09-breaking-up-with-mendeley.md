I have been a long-time user of Mendeley (probably about 2 years) which is a citation manger and it also happen to be a good paper management system. 
But, now my heart is set on Zotero and here's why. 

## It started with buggy LibreOffice support on Ubuntu. 
A few months ago, a bug hit me and disrupt my entire workflow. I accidentally click "insert citation" without opening Mendely first. Normally, a warning would appear and everything will be resolved once I run the two program in parallel. However, not this time! After that incidence, I simply cannot insert citations to my LibreOffice document with Mendeley anymore. Once I tried to insert a new citation, the prompt to insert just would not appear. Instead, the entire Mendeley window shows up. I tried all basic troubleshoots I could think of: search for errors on the web, resetting Mendeley, sing out and in again, complete removing both software and reinstalling it again. Nothing works! 


I hope everyone will have a nice day and enjoy reading more than ever before :-)
