Hi! I am a graduate student in China from Thailand. I spent two and a half year in the country already so I think this is the time where I can give some suggestions to the new comers already. Noted that I came to China to study in science and engineering field, so I was not a Chinese enthusiast in that old days. I am a tech enthusiast :-P. For the first few days that new students are settling in, they would need to learn a lot and I hope that this blog post could guide and alleviate some troubles you might face. Also, it is my personal experience which my change over time. 

## Good to know about Chinese culture

How do the Chinese chopsticks differ from the rest (Japanese and Korean)? Find out in this short TED video.

## China is the world of APPs

In China, you need apps everywhere you go. There are essential apps you should download and have them ready on your phone. You will get familiar with them when you are in China.
- WeChat: instance messaging, social network, payment (WeChat Pay)
- Alipay: payment and others
- Maps: AutoNav Maps (A Map), Baidu Maps


## Why do I need a Chinese app for navigation (map)?

Only map apps authorized to the Chinese authorities are allowed to operate "accurate" map and navigation services in China by rendering the map and coordinating to where you are correctly. This special situation is explained on [*Why Every Map of China is Just Slightly Wrong*](https://youtu.be/L9Di-UVC-_4) by *Half as Interesting*.
