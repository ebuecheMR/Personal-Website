Here are principles I follow for communicating with other people. 

## Table of contents
- [Communication channels](#communication-channels)

## **Call** for emergencies
- **IF**
  - If I'm in Thailand, call the Thai number. 
  - If I'm abraod, call the number abroad. 
  - If you can't call the number abroad, call Thai number. 
- If you can't reach me, please leave a message for faster response. 

## Response time
If I did not response in 24 hours, the message is probably got lost on the way. "Read" status from embeded email links and instant messengers does not count as "received". 

Non-emergency communications have the same response time. So, you're likely to get fast reponse if you email me as well as sending messages via instant messaging. 

## Communication channels
These days, everyone has more than one way to contact them. I also have several ways. Basically, you can contact via many tools. But, here are the preferred ways.

### Preferred contacting channel
- Email - any email addresses would do because I check all of them all the time! 
- Telegram - preferred instanct messaging channel. 

### Unpreferred ways
- WeChat - Here are why: 
  - There are no WeChat for Linux! 
  - Syncing WeChat on mobile and laptop is a mess! 
  - We loose messages all the time, jumping from devices. 
  - Files and photos expire all the time!
- LINE - Here are why: 
  - Files and photos expire all the time!
  - "Read" status obstruct people from reading messages without causing other problems, and there are no turing this functionality off! 
- Facebook Messenger
  - Somehow, FB Messenger does not always work through VPN in China.
